        Introducing the so-called permutation operator $P$ which interchanges
        the labels of particles meaning we can define
            \begin{equation}
                A \equiv \frac{1}{N!}\sum_p(-1)^pP
            \end{equation}
        the so-called \txtit{antisymmetrization} operator. This operator has
        the following traits
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The Hamiltonian $H$ and $A$ commute since the Hamiltonian
                    is invariant under permutation.
                \item $A$ applied on itself (that is $A^2$) is equal to itself
                    since permuting a permuted state reproduces the state.
            \end{itemize}
        We can now express our Slater $\Psi_T$ in terms of $A$ as
            \begin{equation}
                \Psi_T = \sqrt{N!}A\prod_{i,j}\psi_{ij}
            \end{equation}
        where $\psi_{ij}=\psi_j(\blds{r}_i)$ is element $i,j$ of the Slater
        matrix (the matrix associated with the Slater determinant $\Psi_T$).

        The interaction part of $H$ is then
            \begin{equation}
                \dinner{\Psi_T}{H_I} = N!\prod_{i,j}\dinner{\psi_{ij}}{AH_IA}
            \end{equation}
        The interaction $H_I$ and $A$ commute since $A$ commutes with $H$
        giving
            \begin{align}
                AH_IA\ket{\psi_{ij}} &= \frac{1}{N!^2}\sum_{i<j}\sum_{p}
                (-1)^{2p}\fij P\ket{\psi_{ij}} \\
                &= \frac{1}{N!^2}\sum_{i<j}\fij(1-P_{ij})\ket{\psi_{ij}}
            \end{align}
        The factor $1-P_{ij}$ comes from the fact that contributions with
        $i\neq j$ vanishes due to orthogonality when $P$ is applied. The final
        expression for the interaction term is thus
            \begin{equation}
                \dinner{\Psi_T}{H_I} =
                \sum_{i<j}\prod_{k,l}\left[\dinner{\psi_{kl}}{\fij} -
                \bra{\psi_{kl}}\fij\ket{\psi_{lk}}\right]
            \end{equation}
        Writing out the product and realizing the double summation over pairs
        of states we end up with
            \begin{equation}
                \dinner{\Psi_T}{H_I} = \frac{1}{2}
                \sum_{i,j}\left[\dinner{\psi_{ij}\psi_{ji}}{\fij} -
                \bra{\psi_{ij}\psi_{ji}}\fij\ket{\psi_{ji}\psi_{ij}}\right]
            \end{equation}
        More comprehensive details and derivations are given in
        \cite{compphysThijssen,basicMB}.
