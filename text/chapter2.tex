    In this chapter we will address >> LIST METHODS << regarding computational
    quantum mechanics and further deepen into Hartree-Fock methods and
    Variatonal Monte Carlo method. Optimization of calculation is also given
    while structure of program is given in >> REF TO PROGRAM STRUCTURE CHAPTER
    <<. General statistical theory used is given in >> REF TO STATISTICS CHAPTER <<
