    In this chapter we will list general theory regarding functions used in the
    methods mentioned in \Autoref{chapter:3} and show important properties used
    in later derivations.

\section{Gaussian Type Orbitals}
    \txtit{Gaussian Type Orbitals} or GTO's are functions of the following form
    >> REF GTO here <<
        \begin{equation}
            G^{\alpha}_{i}(x,A) \equiv (x-A)^i\me^{-\alpha (x-A)^2}
            \label{eq:GTOdef1d}
        \end{equation}
    We call $\alpha$ for the scaling parameter and $i$ for the order of the
    GTO. The variable $A$ is where the function is centered. These are in many
    literatures referred to as \txtit{primitive gaussians}.
