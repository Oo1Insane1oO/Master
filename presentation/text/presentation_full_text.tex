\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Quantum-Dot}
    What is a quantum-dot?
        - small semiconductor nanostructure that confines motion of conduction.
        - Can be made with i.e electrostatic potentials.
        - $2$-$10$ nanometers in size
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Quantum-Dot Model}
    Schrödinger equation $\mathcal{H}\ket{\psi} = E\ket{\psi}$
        - We model the quantum-dot as a many-body quantum system, meaning we solve the Schrödinger equation.
        - Let us express the hamiltonian
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $\mathcal{H} = - \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits_i \nabla^2_i +
                    \sum_{i<j} f\left(\blds{r}_j, \blds{r}_j\right) -
                    \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits_k \frac{\nabla^2_k}{M_k} + \sum\limits_{k<l}
                    g\left(\blds{R}_k,\blds{R}_l\right) +
                    V\left(\blds{R},\blds{r}\right)$
            \end{itemize}
            - This is the full system with a set of nuclei given here with an
            interaction potential $g$, kinetic for electrons, kinetic for
            nuclei an electron-electron interaction potential and lastly a
            confinement potential.
        - Born-Oppenheimer Approximation
            - Firstly we assume the nuclei to be far heavier than the electrons
            which means the system can be viewed as electrons moving in a
            vicinity around stationary nuclei.
            - The kinetic term then vanishes and the nuclei-interaction is a
            constant which can be ignored since adding a constant to the
            potential only alters the eigenvalues by a constant factor, the
            eigenfunctions remain unchanged.
            - We still need to model the electron-electron interaction and the
            confinement potential
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Quantum-Dot Model}
    How do we model them?
        - Interaction: is the Coulomb repulsion
        - And for the confinement we studied two ways from >> ref <<. One is a simple parabolic-dot modelled by a harmonic oscillator.
        - Other is a double-dot, which is just a harmonic oscillator displaced in the $x$-direction.
        - Notice that for the confinement we have no terms including the nuclei. This is one of the characteristics of quantum-dot systems, we dont just set the nuclei interaction to constant, we also effectively ignore the entire thing (#nuclei have feeling)
\end{frame}

\section{Methods}
- In order to solve the many-body time-independent Schrödinger equation we need
some methods. We have used two method,
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Methods}
    Hartree-Fock(HF)
    Variational Monte-Carlo(VMC)
    - Before we explain the Hartree-Fock method it is worth-while to mention the Variational principle
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Methods: Variational Principle}
    - It states this
    \begin{equation*}
        E_0 \leq \ecp{\mathcal{H}} =
        \frac{\Braket{\Psi|\mathcal{H}|\Psi}}{\Braket{\Psi|\Psi}}
        \label{eq:varPrinc}
    \end{equation*}
    - It basically says that given a system described by some Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ the expectation value of the energy can NEVER be lower than the true ground-state energy of the system $E_0$. This might seem trivial, but it gives us the oppurtunity to define a trial wavefunction $\Psi$ for the the system and then minimize this. This simple idea is the main fundament on which both the Hartree-Fock method and the Variational Monte-Carlo method rests on.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[standout]{Methods: Slater Determinant And Energy Functional}
    Pauli Principle
        - The Pauli principle states that for systems of identical particles no same particle can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.
    Slater Determinant
        - Following this result the many-body wavefunction for a fermionic
        system to be anti-symmetric and represented by a Slater determinant.
        - The P-operator indicates permuations over all possible $\psi_i$ and
        the latter case is the symmetric case present for bosons.
        - Taking the anti-summetric wavefunction as the ansatz for our
        trial-wavefunction we end up with the following energy-functional
        - The H-zero term is just the single-body Hamiltonian
        - This is the start of the Hartree-Fock method.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[standout]{Methods: Hartree-Fock}
    Assumptions
        - The first is already assumed and explained
        - We also restrict the system to not be relativistic. This is true for the low number of particles we work with.
        - The single-slater wavefunction assumption holds as long as we work
        with closed-shell systems. This means that the number of particles
        always fulfills the degeneracy levels, for the HO we have this figure.
        So we we can only run with $N=2,6,12,20$ and so on for $2D$ and
        $N=2,8,20$ for $3D$ for HO-system.
        - An for the MFA, this essentially means that the entire interaction
        potential can be described as a mean potential rather than specific
        individual point-potentials for each particle. This is fulfilled with
        the Coulomb interaction.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[standout]{Methods: Hartree-Fock}
    Contrained Minimization
        - As mentioned we need to minimize the energy. We notice one
        constraint, the spin orthogonality. We can minimize with the Lagrange
        multiplier method with the following Lagrangian. The delta-E part is
        the energy variation we seek the zero of.
        - We then define a Fock-operator giving the eigenvalue equation, and
        two operators defined from the energy-functional.
        - We then have $N+1$ equations to be solved
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Methods: Hartree-Fock}
    Integrate out spin
        - The $\psi$'s have till now all been spin-orbitals. That is a
        wavefunction consisting of a spacial function multiplied by a spin
        function. It is convenient to integrate the spin dependency out of the
        eigenvalue equation. There exists two ways of achieving this.
    Pair spins as
        - where $\phi$ is the spacial part and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two
        spin configurations, up and down.
        - We restrict both the spin-configurations to have the same spacial
        function.
    Expand
        - and expand the spacial part in some known basis $\xi$ (i.e HO)
    Roothan-Hall
        - and end up with the Roothan-Hall equation with the elements of the
        Fock-matrix as this, the sum now only goes up-to $N/2$ because of the
        spin pairing
    Poople-Nesbet
        - If we dont restrict the spin-orbitals we end up with two Roothan-Hall
        equations and a Fock-Matrix with mixed elements.
    - The equations are a set of non-linear equations and have to be solvet
    iteratively until a convergence is reached.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Methods: Hartree-Fock}
    - The algorithm is to first pre-build the two-body, one-body and overlap
    matrices. The initial coefficients can be set to unit-matrix if nothing
    else is known. Set the Fock matrix either the restricted or the
    unrestricted form. Perform an optional mixing of $F$. Solve the generalized
    eigenvalue problem, calculate density matrix, mix this if desired, check
    for convergence. If reached calculate energy and end, if not save
    eigenvalues and density matrix (for mixing).
